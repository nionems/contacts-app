This React code creates a responsive contacts list application with a modern UI. Here's how it works:

Contacts Loading: Contacts are fetched from an API in pages, sorted alphabetically, and displayed as clickable cards.
Contact Details: Clicking a card shows a popup with detailed contact information.
Load More: A "Load More" button fetches more contacts if available.
Error Handling: Displays an error if contacts fail to load.
Design Features: Includes a header with a logo, styled grid for contact cards, and a footer with copyright info.

To create the contact list app, the following technologies are used:

React: JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, particularly for dynamic, single-page applications.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client used to make requests to the API to fetch the contacts.
CSS: For custom styling the contact list and details, ensuring a responsive layout across devices.
JavaScript: Core language to handle data fetching, state management (using useState), and side effects (using useEffect).
